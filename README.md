# Skye Kychenthal's Professional Website

Can be found at: [skymocha.github.io](skymocha.github.io)

Skye Kychenthal's more personal-oriented website can be found at [www.skymocha.net](https://www.skymocha.net/)

## Directories

The main reason this website is set up is to share class notes, and to act as a static server for certain important files & pages in the event that www.skymocha.net is down. I trust GitHub more than myself :)

Directories are as follows:

* /*
* /resume.pdf
* /publications.html*
* /Courses/:Course/

`*` indicates that a directory can also be accessed from [people.reed.edu/~skychenthal/](https://people.reed.edu/~skychenthal/)
