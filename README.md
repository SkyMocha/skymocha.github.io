## Information
Hi! I'm [Skye Kychenthal](https://www.skymocha.net). The purposes of this website are:
* To facilitate an easier sharing of my homework for the purposes of collaboration, to help out fellow students (copying is NOT permitted)
* To get in the habit/spirit of open-sourcing work. Compared to my main site, this website is incredibly light-weight by being based on simple .html and simple .md files. 
* To serve as a file upload source for the purposes of a [publications.html (temporary)](/pub_temp.html) & [resume](/resume.pdf).

## Courses

* [MATH 111](Math 111) 
* [CSCI 122](csci 122) 
* [SOC 221](Soc 221)

## Notes
All courses taken are at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu). The most up-to-date course catalog can be found [here](https://www.reed.edu/catalog/). As all notes & work done here are written by Skye Kychenthal, they should NOT be submitted as your own original work. This is called plagarism.
