## HUM 110 Class Notes & Papers

The focus of my Hum 110 class is making me a better writer. I try to tackle challenging & unique topics throughout my year in Hum 110 to try and craft compelling but most importantly unique arguments. I want my papers to be _fun_.

## Notes

All courses taken are at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu). The most up-to-date course catalog can be found [here](https://www.reed.edu/catalog/). As all notes & work done here are written by Skye Kychenthal, they should NOT be submitted as your own original work. This is called plagiarism.
