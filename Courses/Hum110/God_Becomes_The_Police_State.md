## God Becomes The Police State

### Abstract

The story of Cain & Abel presents us the first instance of murder within the story of Genesis, and within the Torah. A question can be posed from this: what does this story tell us? Murder is a phenomenon existing since the creation of The Bible and before; and, unilaterally it can be argued murder is bad. What does the Torah, but more specifically Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel tell us about murder, and about God’s role in preventing murder. God, through his actions, becomes a figure similar to Big Brother, or the authoritarian state, from George Orwell’s 1984, and enforces a sort of mental panopticon (a prison where you never know if you’re being watched) akin to the authoritarian thought police or thinkpol from 1984.

### There exists theories as to why God exists.

> "... if you want to get thousands of stranger to work as a team, you need something to hold things together. This glue has to be stronger than friendliness ... the human brain is not equipped to juggle [hundreds] of meaningful relationships. Projects on [the] scale [of pyramids] call for... [leaders] to incentivize us. How? With myths. We learned to _imagine_ kinship with people we'd never met. Religions, states, companies, nations ... only exist in our minds. No one has ever ... shaken hands with 'the Roman Catholic Church.' But that doesn't matter if we sign on for the fiction. The most obvious example of such a myth is, of course, God. Or call it the original Big Brother. The question is: where did we get this belief in an omnipotent God? And in a God angered by human sin? ... Rulers needed someone to keep tabs on the masses. Someone who heard and saw everything. An all-seeing eye. God."

This theory states, quite simply, that gods and myths exist (or were created) to bring people together to form societies and large-scale societal projects. These societies can create pyramids, rockets that go to the moon, or even conquer other societies. God is the original Big Brother; a concept from George Orwell's 1984 signifying the surveillance state able to even surveil a populations thoughts. In order for these societies to function, they needed to create soldiers, farmers, construction workers; something Foucault describes as the creation docile bodies (Foucault 135). A docile body is a body or individual molded through discipline removing their individual power (Foucault 138). God or Gods, in these early societies, serve to police the thoughts of citizens in a way that a police force can't, while also creating docile bodies malleable by the state. While in modern times we can do this through surveillance, laws and policing, schools and prisons; the Judaic God provides a surveillance stronger than any individual institution especially in ancient times. 

### God's punishments are inevitable.

Throughout the 17th century, punishments and torture shifted from deterrence through public spectacle to deterrence through the inevitability of punishment. (Foucault, 9) [Ecclesiastes 12:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.14?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en) states "that God will call every creature to account everything unknown, be it good or bad." (Jewish Publication Society) God, in this context, gains a sort of inevitability to punishment. That any deed, whether good or bad, even ones that no one other than the doer knows of, will be seen by God and more importantly judged by God. This is similar to our modern systems of deterrence (the idea of: "don't do the crime if you can't do the time"); however, the story of Cain and Abel shows us a different perspective to God's punishments. Cain is sent to wander the earth, unable to be killed, despite wanting death after murdering Abel (Genesis 4:15). Cain's punishment, therefore, is spectacle (Foucault 9) as much as it is inevitable. God's punishments throughout Genesis take on a dual role of spectacle and inevitability, exampled in Cain & Abel or The Great Flood; though God's theatrical punishments can also be seen as disproportional to the crime (Foucault 9). This could explain why methods of punishment took on a more theatrical tone in feudal societies, such as the punishment of quartering (dividing someone into four parts), since punishments before the a reformation from spectacle to inevitability (as Foucault talks about) were guided by theocratic systems rather than republican systems. A move from theocracy and monarchy to republic coincided with a move from spectacle to inevitable. God's punishments throughout Genesis show us spectacle combined with God's unique role as the ultimate arbiter of justice.s

### God act's similarly to George Orwell's 1984 or Foucault's Panopticon.

Although taking on the meaning first described as a "prison where you never know if you're being watched," a panopticon is a specific architectural layout for a prison. It is circular, with a large watchtower in the middle, where inmates cannot see where inside the center tower, and cannot see the other inmates (Foucault 200). This creates a situation in which the prisoners "are like so many cages, so many small theatres, in which each actor is alone, perfectly individualized and constantly visible... he is seen, but he does not see" (Foucault 200). These prisoners cannot see each other, so they cannot communicate any plans of rebellion; and, these prisoners cannot see if they are watched at any given moment. In prisons, warden's and guard's discipline through power. This power gives them a authority and status higher than the prisoner alongside an ability to punish. What the panopticon does is "[assure] the automatic functioning of power" (Foucault 201), meaning this power-dynamic always exists even if there is no warden or guard watching the prisoner; because, the prisoner never knows if they are watched at any given moment. This is also explained by the concept of Big Brother, or the surveillance state, in 1984. The thought police, or thinkpol, in 1984 tapped wires and monitored civilians randomly, leading the narrator to admit, "there was of course no way of knowing if you were being watched at any given moment... You had to live... in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every move scrutinized" (Orwell 5). A power-dynamic such as that of the panopticon and prisoners or Big Brother and Orwellian society does not need to be constant. It just needs to happen in such a way that you can never be quite sure you are safe. God, through his inevitability in punishments, is able to create a force *stronger* than panopticism or Big Brother - because those who believe in the Judaic God know all their deeds, seen or not, will be brought to Judgement by God.

### The story of Cain and Abel serves as an example of God's judgement.

The story begins with both Cain and Abel presenting offerings to God; Abel's is accepted, meanwhile Cain's is ignored. Cain is envious. God says to Cain, "Why are you so distressed... ? \ if you do right, There is uplift. But if you do not do right Sin couches at the door; It's urge is toward you, Yet you can be its master." (Genesis 4:6) God warns Cain, setting down laws: if you do right, you will be rewarded; otherwise sin may be tempting, yet you can overcome the temptation. In the very next verse, Cain gives into the temptation of sin and kills Abel. By the policing of God, and the laws he put forth, Abel *could* have mastered the temptation, so his failure to do so is in contradiction to the teachings of God. God, presumably omnipresent, tests Cain: "where is your brother Abel?" (Genesis 4:9); to which Cain responds with a lie: "I do not know." (Genesis 4:9) Not only does Cain give into sin and envy, but he also lies to God about the murder. God, however, is able to judge acts humans believe to be unseen ([Ecclesiastes 12:14](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.14?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)), stating that "your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground!" (Genesis 4:10) God chooses to provide a punishment of spectacle, likely as a deterrent to all readers of the Torah, and those who live during the time of Cain. Cain is set to be more cursed than the ground, unable to till it as before, and left to ceaselessly wander the Earth without ability to be killed (Genesis 4:12). Cain is no longer a citizen of God's domain, a farmer, but now a walking spectacle of shame so all can see the punishment that falls on those who commit murder.

### Examining the story of Cain and Abel let's us understand the place of religion.
Rutger Bregman describes God as the original Big Brother, and it's no wonder why. Through a constant form of surveillance and an inevitability of judgement & punishment, it's arguable God is a stronger force than Big Brother and the panopticon for those who believe in God. This solidifies this explanation as to the purpose of God in early societies. In societies that likely did not have the resources for a police state, a divine entity capable to policing for them would be similar to instilling a panopticon or Big Brother as those who believe in God know they will always be watched and judged. Citizens, therefore, have to act accordingly. An issue with this theory in both modern times and ancient times arises from two points.

1. What does one do with those who do not believe in God?
2. What does one do with those who do believe in God, but commit murder nonetheless?

The story of Cain and Abel presents us with one possibility as to what happens to individuals who commit murder despite full acknowledgement of God's inevitability in punishment: they are punished through spectacle for deterrence. In modern times, this form of spectacle does not exist by the church or the states. And because God's judgement happens *after* death, nobody alive has seen God pass down judgement. Thats why it is possible for people to act not in according to God; and that is why those who do act in accordance with God can still commit murder and extremist acts. Those who commit murder on premises they believe to be in accordance with God will not receive judgement until after their death: a time where they cannot communicate with others. The role of God in modern and ancient society, especially in regards to murder, is incredibly complex, yet simple and ultimately fascinating. The story of Cain and Abel, however, alongside this exploration of 1984 and Foucault serves to explain some of the context for God and religion's role in disciplining and order.
