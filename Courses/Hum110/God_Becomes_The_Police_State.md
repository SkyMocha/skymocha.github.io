## God Becomes The Police State

### Abstract

The story of Cain & Abel presents us the first instance of murder within the story of Genesis, and within the Torah. A question can be posed from this: what does this story tell us? Murder is a phenomenon existing since the creation of The Bible and before; and, unilaterally it can be argued murder is bad. So, what does the Torah, but more specifically Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel tell us about murder, and about god’s role in preventing murder. God, through his actions, becomes a figure similar to Big Brother, or the authoritarian state, from George Orwell’s 1984, and enforces a sort of mental panopticon (a prison where you never know if you’re being watched) akin to the authoritarian thought police or thinkpol from 1984.

### There exists theories as to why God exists.

> "... if you want to get thousands of stranger to work as a team, you need something to hold things together. This glue has to be stronger than friendliness ... the human brain is not equipped to juggle [hundreds] of meaningful relationships. Projects on [the] scale [of pyramids] call for... [leaders] to incentivize us. How? With myths. We learned to _imagine_ kinship with people we'd never met. Religions, states, companies, nations ... only exist in our minds. No one has ever ... shaken hands with 'the Roman Catholic Church.' But that doesn't matter if we sign on for the fiction. The most obvious example of such a myth is, of course, God."
