# Week 4 Hum 110: Skye Kychenthal's Bible Experiment  

## Timeline to completion

CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE. LAST UPDATE 9/20/2022 at 10:30 AM PST

## Abstract

This week, I will be exploring The Bible through the lens of two books: Mindf*ck by Christopher Wylie and HumanKind by Rutger Bregman to explore two hypotheses:

1. _Does Genesis support an inevitable radicalization into the Alt-Right?_
2. _Does Genesis support a theocratic theory of naivete?_

## Introduction

For this week, me and a classmate were tasked with creating 2 discussion questions for our Tuesday Hum 110 course.

The assignment calls for reading an [introduction](https://www.reed.edu/humanities/hum110/course-resources/2022-23/2022-09-19-21.html) + first 20 chapters of Genesis + Jaffee pp. 1-28 + a lecture. I will likely create some form of lecture based on the materials and my hypotheses based on this week for YouTube. The link will be updated here when done.

My hypotheses for questions to pose before would be as follow:

## Hypotheses

1. Based on Christopher Wylie's Mindf*ck, a sense of _being in the closet_ is a major contributor to alt-right radicalization. How does the opening of Genesis contribute to radicalization into the modern alt-right theocratic state in America. Is radicalization for Catholics, and therefore theocracy, inevitable? 

2. Based on chapter 11 of Humankind by Rutger Bregman, specifically p. 233, how is the _theocratic theory of naivety_ (as I will term it) substantiated by Genesis chapter 1-20.

The _theocratic theory of naivety_ can be best described by the quote:

> "... if you want to get thousands of stranger to work as a team, you need something to hold things together. This glue has to be stronger than friendliness ... the human brain is not equipped to juggle [hundreds] of meaningful relationships. Projects on [the] scale [of pyramids] call for... [leaders] to incentivize us. How? With myths. We learned to _imagine_ kinship with people we'd never met. Religions, states, companies, nations ... only exist in our minds. No one has ever ... shaken hands with 'the Roman Catholic Church.' But that doesn't matter if we sign on for the fiction. The most obvious example of such a myth is, of course, God." 
> 
> (Bregman 2019: p. 233)

## Support & Counters for Hypotheses 

### The Bible inherently supports alt-right ideology (Hypothesis #1)
God is the inherent arbiter of that which is good. He creates light, and declares light to be good (Genesis 1:4). He separates light from the darkness, and declares it is bad. He makes man in God's likeness, therefore, man _must_ be good. He creates male and female in that likeness (Genesis 1:28). It is my opinion that there are inherent biases in this text that presuppose racism and transphobia common to United States bigotry. 
1. Separating light and dark as good and bad respectively could be interpreted as light-skinned people are good, and dark-skinned people are bad. Dark-skinned people, as a result, are _not_ children of God.
2. Separating men and women into two distinct binary categories gives a religious context to the Catholic idea that trans people do not exist. 
If transphobia and race-based bigotry is built into the bible, it is almost inevitable in a world that skews to progressive ideologies that those who follow The Bible to an extreme would become religious extremists. They would feel closeted, they could be fired for bigoted beliefs etc., and therefore be more easily indoctrinated into alt-right ideologies.

Genesis 2:23 supports alt-right misogynistic ideologies as, according to canonical Catholic ideologies, women were created _from_ men and therefore are inherently created _for_ men. (This is not very feminist of god SMH). 6:1 through 6:3 support this notion of male supremacy, as it can be read as men being seen as "divine beings" who take wives for the sake of pleasure. 

### The Bible states man is inherently good (Hypothesis #2)

#### Argument:
The argument of Rutger Bregman in humankind is that human-kind is inherently good. God creates man in his likeness, and man is good. 

#### Counterargument:
Women. While man may be good, the bible throughout implies men are superior to women. 

### God becomes is the police state (Hypothesis #2)

#### Argument
The story of Cain & Abel (4:8 --> 4:17) is the first instance in the Genesis of murder. Cain, in killing Abel, is banished by God himself, and despite Cain's wishes, is not allowed to die as punishment. For people who adhere to the bible, it is clear that acts of jealousy & especially acts of violence will result in direct punishment from God. It is not the state or the police that governs, but a deity that directly imposes their values onto the populous.

#### Complication
In modern times, Catholic extremists do hold prejudices and violent ones against women & minorities. I don't think this actually contradicts the tale of Cain and Abel. The bible can be interpreted to see dark people as bad, women as subservient to men, and trans people as abnormal (as stated in [The Bible inherently supports alt-right ideology](#the-bible-inherently-supports-alt-right-ideology-hypothesis-1)). The murder of ones own hegemonic group is bad, murder of an "abnormal" group is okay.

#### Complication to Complication

Jesus is not white. God, realistically, is not white.

#### Counterargument

It could be argued that God cannot be the police state within the context of Genesis. Genesis 8:2 basically states that God kinda... just forgot about Noah for 150 days before stopping the great deluge. God is not some omnipresent being, but, as God creates man in His image, God is just a very powerful man. If God is simply just a very powerful man and not omnipresent, he cannot be the "thought police" for all of civilization as stated in the _theocratic theory of naivete_. Because of events like "judgement" and "the rapture" of which I know nothing, it could be argued that God is omnipresent, at least at the death of an individual. For my argument that [God becomes the police statement](#god-becomes-is-the-police-state-hypothesis-2) to work, God has to be omni-present at the very least when judging whether a human goes to Heaven or Hell.

## Class

Class in which my discussion questions will be posted shalt be held on 9/20/2022.

### Discussion Question

My discussion question has some preface, especially since I am biased against the bible and  could be controversial. I think that the most important lessons we can gain from history & the humanities are from how we compare the past to our present. My discussion question will focus on the modern alt-right, which I would classify as religious extremism. Since the Torah is a  basis for the Christian Bible, I want to explore how the Torah can lead to modern alt-right Christian fundamentalist ideals. So here's my discussion question:

> Literature on right-wing radicalization shows that people who feel "in the closet" about racist, misogynist, and transphobic ideas are some of the most susceptible to radicalization. How can our translation (and I emphasize our translation, as I have been told by friends who know Hebrew well this is not the accurate to how they view the Torah) of Genesis be interpreted in a way contributing to the racist, misogynistic, and transphobic ideas at the root of the right-wing "closeted" identity in America. Specifically: 1:4, 1:28, & 2:23 of our reading. Beyond this, in other translations similar to our bible [3:16: The Contemporary Torah](https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.16?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en) Further, 

1. is this a miss-understanding of how the Genesis should be viewed as a biblical text or are these prejudices built into the Genesis? 
2. if it is a miss-understanding, how do we view Christian extremism in this light?
3. how can the Bible be a unifying force rather than dividing, as it has been in more contemporary history?
