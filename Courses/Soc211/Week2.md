### Martin 1998 & Gansen 2017

Margin 1998 is genuinely one of the best academic articles I have ever read. I even put it in my recommended readings list! (https://skymocha.github.io/reading) As a trans person, this (and Gansen 2017) are genuinely articles that make me question not only how the people around me were raised, how society around me is structured; but most importantly how I was raised. How I was socialized to be male, but transitioned to being somewhere on the non-binary spectrum but also presenting as a trans girl. Do I carry myself differently as a result? Am I viewed intrinsically differently because of even minute things as my posture and the way I take up space? Is this a good thing? A bad thing? Something that is completely neutral? Is this what led me to choosing computer science as a path (the answer to that one is yes lol check arXiv:2205.01553).

These papers, though, were not only insightful but terrifying. Gansen 2017 was so terrifying I genuinely wish Hyrack put a content warning lol. The ways in which Gansen takes an objective look at what are some extremely disturbing aspects of preschool classrooms, and how they most likely lead to men’s gendered power, rape culture, heteronormativity, the feeling of shame most queer people face, etc. etc. It’s almost too insightful.

Meanwhile, Martin 1998 strikes a different kind of fear. It’s a revolutionary and extremely progressive paper on the practices of gendered socialization in children. It argues against contemporary topics such as the Don’t Say Gay bills in Florida and probably by now multiple other states. And the reason this is terrifying comes with the citation: Martin 1998. This shit was written in 1998. What the fuck. Not only does it make me feel as though we haven’t progressed as a society, but in some ways, regressed as a society.

### Mead 1934

I did not finish reading this! Overall, I think the ideas are genuinely great, but my issue boils down to my inability to parse the long sentences and exactly what Mead is trying to say. The idea of utilizing games in order to discuss larger sociological topics is genuinely fascinating. I have interned working on how games (specifically DOTA2) can be used to further the cognitive abilities of AI. Ideas like the generalized other (whatever that means) can be garnered from simply thinking about baseball. All in all, though, I don’t like is that I physically have to google or search for someone else to dumb it down to me to be able to understand what he’s actually saying. Since I have a… yknow… sociology class I’ll ask the sociology class to explain it to me :)

### Notes

- Durkheim → Group-think (psychological term too)
- Sociology History!
  - Mead did sociology during rapid urbanization around the time of WW1 and WW2 →
    - One of the people (Mead) who wanted to study how people were supposed to exist within such rapid and centralized urbanization
    - Muckrakers → How were the workers being exploited in America?
      - Sociology in U of Chicago started with aligning with Muckrakers.
      - Muckrakers v. Elites
        - Muckrakers → for the workers
        - Elites
          - Often utilized certain things like racism to stay in power
    - How were selves created from the individual upwards?
      - How do we understand society?
    - “Science of humanity”
    - What psychologists (piaget, freud) wanted for sociology
    - Sociologists (U of Chicago, etc.) disagreed with “context is everything”
      - Micro vs. Micro
      - Study & observe what happens between people

### Ragin and Amoroso 2011

I honestly did not get from this paper what most other people got from it. I went into this paper with almost a broader view of what social research is in contrast to other natural science fields who exclusively use concrete evidence & data gathering methods. Everyone else in the class seemed to gain an idea that social research was cooler and more broad than they would expect. This goes to show how differently I believe in what exactly social research is. I went into this with the idea that something like Caelen’s 3 part series on Gender Critical communities is social research, journalism, and documentary. It’s an ethnographic study, but also includes exclusively journalistic elements, and also is kind of a documentary on exactly who and what GC people are. Wild how differently I assumed other people thought.

### Streib 2011

“Why is it the people who take up the most space the ones with the highest SES?”

Haven’t finished this one so I will come back to my numerous thoughts later. Come back to: 9/16/2022

### Notes

- Sociology → “otherness” in U.S. cities
  - Uses pluralistic research methods;
    - Ethnography (similar to anthropology)
  - Similar in a lot of ways to anthropology
    - Anthropology → Otherness in places and cultures
  - Borrows from:
    - Poli sci
    - Uses data sets. etc.
