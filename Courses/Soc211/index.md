## Notes

All courses taken are at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu). The most up-to-date course catalog can be found [here](https://www.reed.edu/catalog/). As all notes & work done here are written by Skye Kychenthal, they should NOT be submitted as your own original work. This is called plagarism.
