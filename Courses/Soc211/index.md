## Skye Kychenthal Soc 211

The focus of my sociology class is reading, and as a result, I focus highly on giving my thoughts and opinions on different sociological texts.

## Final Project

For our final project for Sociology 211 at Reed College, we were asked to do unique research on a topic through research methods we have learned in our time in Soc 211. I decided that to motivate myself to the fullest extent on this project, I would go above what my professor asked us to do, but not so overboard I could not complete the project within 1 month. In the end I chose to work on a project involving simple data-science to replicate a project done on the Men's Rights movement to TERF and Gender Critical communities.

All code for this project can be found at [https://github.com/SkyMocha/TERF-LDA](https://github.com/SkyMocha/TERF-LDA)
