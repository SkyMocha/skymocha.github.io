### C. Wright Mills. “The Sociological Imagination “Chapter 1: The Promise”

#### What does Mills mean by a sociological imagination?

What Mills views as the sociological imagination is an almost hyper-aware doom-and-gloom
perspective on society that he hopes would bring about more action. In a more “normal” sense,
he hopes for everyone to view the world with context: why do we live in this system? Why did
that system come to be? Where in history are we? Etc. I genuinely do think this is helpful, but,
then again, it’s also framed in such a depressing and almost elitist way by Mills (see my own
notes).

#### This reading was published in the 1950s. Is it still relevant today? If so, how does it speak to you and your commitments?

It definitely is still relevant today. I am somehow reminded of the Amazon Labor Union, and I
can’t quite put my finger on why that specific union. Maybe it’s just that, Amazon has such
shit working conditions that realistically every single warehouse should be unionized. But,
without a sociological imagination, which is actively squashed by Amazon’s union-busting,
there is no hope of a union. Therefore, fostering a sociological imagination (which the ALU
pres. Is doing) is incredibly difficult. On a more personal note, the sociological imagination
has led me to making a YouTube channel, but also has led me to being a little more depressed.
Because my commitments are so intertwined with history, and with the systems in place, that it
can be overwhelming at times.

#### Notes

One of the things that concerns me about this piece is the almost elitest nature of it. It really
started to become clear at “They do not possess the quality of mind essential to grasp the
interplay…” (1) The whole piece revolves around a doom-and-gloom reaading from an outside
& vantaged perspective on the goings-ons of the layperson. Certain parts, like this, and like on
page 2 (“information often… their capacities to assimilate it”, “the skills of reason… exhaust
their limited moral energy.”) feel really icky.

### Charles Cooley, The Looking Glass Self

#### Cooley's main term is the looking-glass self: define this term and explain the 3 processes by which a self is formed.

The looking-glass self is a self-image that is influenced by other people. Rather than traditionally saying “I am tall,” (a reallyyyyy simple statement) the looking-glass self really asks: “why do I think I am tall? For who does this matter? Who will judge me or praise me for being tall? Am I proud? Ashamed?” The looking-glass self is made of the three components of how we appear to others, how we believe they will judge us on said appearance, and the feelings we received based on this (pride, shame, etc.).

#### Charles Cooley, The Looking Glass Self

1. I am trans. A lot of my transition is for myself, but, there are many aspects of my transition
   that are for other people. I want to work on my weight to appear more feminine, I want to look
   pretty and dress nicely so other people praise me and gender me correctly. Pronouns are
   entirely for the benefit of other people, not for my own. So much of my identity is constructed
   on the basis that there are other people around me

2. I am smart. This is a bit of a weird one, but the only reason I consider myself smart a lot of
   the time, is because other people say I am. People judge me on my intelligence, they judge
   positively, and it gives me pride. There’s definitely a lot more complexity there, but its 6:45 AM I’m still waking up :(

## Notes 9/16/2022

Looking back, I think I was too harsh on Mills. I genuinely believe that the ideas he espouses of looking at life from a more sociological lens is incredibly valuable, but I believe the ways in which he writes about it are kind of bad.
