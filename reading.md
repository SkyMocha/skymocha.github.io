## Recommended Books

These books are most likely transformative in some way to how I view the world, who I am as a person, and the way I think. 

### (9.5/10) Fight Club. 1999. Movie (& book).

Chuck Palahaniuk is a master-class troll whose insanity has produced the foundations for Fight Club the movie. There is an abundance to analyze about this movie, alongside the compelling plot, the small cast of characters, and incredibly editing & pacing. My favorite movie. I have wasted 5 months researching it!

### (9/10) Disco Elysium. 2019. Video Game.

Do you want to talk to write multiple paragraphs to your friends about the morality of power vacuums and their creation of police states and dictatorships based solely off 5 minutes of gameplay? Or, do you want to discuss with your friend whether or not it's worth shooting a 12 year old for impeding in a police investigation (/j). Do you want to talk to your own psyche about the morality of capitalism, communism, incremental progressive advancement, and why you are sorry to everyone ALL THE TIME? Do you want the best writing and voice acting video games have to offer? Do you want a story worth at least a few PhD thesies? Go play Disco Elysium even if you answered no to all of these.

### (9/10) *Mindf_ck*, *Christopher Wylie*, 2019. Book.

Do you want to engage in election swaying and psychological warfare? Well this is the book for you! *Mindf_ck* is a memoir by Christopher Wylie during his time at Cambridge Analytica: psychological warfare firm turned Trump propaganda machine. The amount of information about the creation myth of America's alt-right combined with the richness of knowledge and information is appealing and this is one of the few books I can confidently say I could not stop reading 


Further reading: [*Does Microtargetting Work?*](https://muhark.github.io/static/docs/harukawa-2021-microtargeting.pdf), *Mushashi Jacobs-Harukawa* (in case you want to know how to swing a state's elections!)

### (8.5/10) *HumanKind*, *Rutger Bregman*. 2019. Book.

Restored my faith in humanity. I am indeed a homo puppy :)

### (8/10) *Neon Genisis Evangellion* & *FLCL*. 1995 & 2000. Anime.

I am putting these two Ginax anime together because of how they are special to me.  

### (8/10) Twitter & Tear Gas

Have only read chapter 4. Reading for Sociology. Will give my thoughts later!
