## Recommended Books

These books are most likely transformative in some way to how I view the world, who I am as a person, and the way I think. This is why, for example, I do some very... unique things like rate Fight Club higher than Neon Genisis Evangelion. Subjectivity is the greatest measure here!

### (9.5/10) Fight Club. 1999. Movie (& book).

Chuck Palahaniuk is a master-class troll whose insanity has produced the foundations for Fight Club the movie. There is an abundance to analyze about this movie, alongside the compelling plot, the small cast of characters, and incredibly editing & pacing. I have wasted 5 months researching it! My favorite movie.

### (9/10) Disco Elysium. 2019. Video Game.

Do you want to talk to write multiple paragraphs to your friends about the morality of power vacuums and their creation of police states and dictatorships based solely off 5 minutes of gameplay? Or, do you want to discuss with your friend whether or not it's worth shooting a 12 year old for impeding in a police investigation (/j). Do you want to talk to your own psyche about the morality of capitalism, communism, incremental progressive advancement, and why you are sorry to everyone ALL THE TIME? Do you want the best writing and voice acting video games have to offer? Do you want a story worth at least a few PhD thesies? Go play Disco Elysium even if you answered no to all of these.

### (9/10) *Mindf_ck*, *Christopher Wylie*, 2019. Book.

Do you want to engage in election swaying and psychological warfare? Well this is the book for you! *Mindf_ck* is a memoir by Christopher Wylie during his time at Cambridge Analytica: psychological warfare firm turned Trump propaganda machine. The amount of information about the creation myth of America's alt-right combined with the richness of knowledge and information is appealing and this is one of the few books I can confidently say I could not stop reading 


Further reading: [*Does Microtargetting Work?*](https://muhark.github.io/static/docs/harukawa-2021-microtargeting.pdf), *Mushashi Jacobs-Harukawa* (in case you want to know how to swing a state's elections!)

### (8.5/10) *Pathologic is Genius, And Here is Why*, *HBomberGuy*. 2020. YouTube.

I have watched this video in its entirety twice. The depth of which Brewis goes through Pathalogic's game design aspects from the perspective of "art" rather than a purely "good" gameplay experience revolutionized the way I view media when I first watched this video two years ago. This video got me into HBomberGuy. HBomberGuy got me into left-tube. I was tempted to just include all of HBomberGuy's channel, but, I picked this specific video because of what it means to me.

### (8.5/10) *HumanKind*, *Rutger Bregman*. 2019. Book.

Restored my faith in humanity. I am indeed a homo puppy :)

### (8/10) *Neon Genisis Evangellion* & *FLCL*, *Studio Ginax*. 1995 & 2000. Anime.

I am putting these two Ginax anime together because of how they are special to me. I'll write more at a later date :)

### (8/10) Twitter & Tear Gas 

Have only read chapter 4. Reading for Sociology. This book is making me question how I view political action, how I should view political action going forward, and what I should *do* going forward. Will give more of my thoughts later!

### (7.5/10) *Tracing The Roots of Pop Culture Transphobia*, *Lindsey Ellis*. 2021. YouTube. 

Highly recommend. Lindsey Ellis explores the pop culture roots of transphobia in the media we watch. Genuinely super informative video, especially for its short duration of just under one hour!
