## Recommended Books

These books are most likely transformative to how I view the world, who I am as a person, and the way I think. This is why, for example, I do some very... unique things like rate Fight Club higher than Neon Genisis Evangelion. Subjectivity is the greatest measure here!

### (9.5/10) Fight Club. 1999. Movie (& book).

My favorite movie. Chuck Palahaniuk is a master-class troll whose insanity has produced the foundations for Fight Club the movie. There is an abundance to analyze about this movie, alongside its compelling plot, small cast of characters, and incredible & unique editing & pacing. I have wasted 5 months researching it!

### (9/10) Disco Elysium. 2019. Video Game.

Do you want to write multiple paragraphs to your friends about the morality of power vacuums and their creation of police states and dictatorships based solely off 5 minutes of gameplay? Or, do you want to discuss with your friend whether or not it's worth shooting a 12 year old for impeding in a police investigation (/j). Do you want to talk to your own psyche about the morality of capitalism, communism, incremental progressive advancement, and why you are sorry to everyone ALL THE TIME? Do you want the best writing and voice acting video games have to offer? Do you want a story worth at least a few PhD theses? Go play Disco Elysium even if you answered no to all of these.

### (9/10) _Mindf_ck_, _Christopher Wylie_, 2019. Book.

Do you want to engage in election swaying and psychological warfare? Well this is the book for you! _Mindf_ck_ is a memoir by Christopher Wylie during his time at Cambridge Analytica: psychological warfare firm turned Trump propaganda machine. The amount of information about the creation myth of America's alt-right combined with the richness of knowledge and information is appealing and this is one of the few books I can confidently say I could not stop reading

Further reading: [_Does Microtargetting Work?_](https://muhark.github.io/static/docs/harukawa-2021-microtargeting.pdf), _Mushashi Jacobs-Harukawa_ (in case you want to know how to swing a state's elections!)

### (8.5/10) _Pathologic is Genius, And Here is Why_, _HBomberGuy_. 2020. YouTube.

I have watched this video in its entirety twice. The depth of which Brewis goes through Pathalogic's game design aspects from the perspective of "art" rather than a purely "good" gameplay experience revolutionized the way I view media when I first watched this video two years ago. This video got me into HBomberGuy. HBomberGuy got me into left-tube. I was tempted to just include all of HBomberGuy's channel, but, I picked this specific video because of what it means to me.

### (8.5/10) _HumanKind_, _Rutger Bregman_. 2019. Book.

Restored my faith in humanity. I am indeed a homo puppy :)

### (8/10) _Neon Genisis Evangellion_ & _FLCL_, _Studio Ginax_. 1995 & 2000. Anime.

I am putting these two Ginax anime together because of how they are special to me. I'll write more at a later date :)

### (8/10) _Becoming A Gendered Body_, _Karin A. Martin_. 1998. Journal Article.

"Children's bodies are disciplined by schools," (Martin 1998) not in the incentivization of docility [1], but in the creation of gendered bodies. The ways in which women "sit, stand, gesture, walk, and throw... [by taking] up less physical space... [or not] throwing from the shoulder." (Martin 1998). Karin A. Martin explores how the ways in which pre-schoolers are encouraged to dress, act, and exist in physical space influences the ways in which children learned gender. Further reading goes to show how this research can be the basis for looks into, say, the construction of heteronormativity [2].

To change a mind is to change a body, and to change a body is to change a mind. As a trans-femme, this article makes me sit down with my pre-conceived notions of masculinity and femininity and explore the ways in which my upbringing & transition not just influences/d the ways in which I act, but the ways in which I carry my body and exist in physical space.

My only gripe with this journal article is (although _very_ briefly mentioned) heavy focus on middle-class white children. I wonder how me going to pre-school in Chile would have changed the results.

### (7.5/10) Twitter & Tear Gas

Have only read chapter 4. Reading for Sociology. This book is making me question how I view political action, how I should view political action going forward, and what I should _do_ going forward. Will give more of my thoughts later!

### (7.5/10) _Tracing The Roots of Pop Culture Transphobia_, _Lindsey Ellis_. 2021. YouTube.

Highly recommend. Lindsey Ellis explores the pop culture roots of transphobia in the media we watch. Genuinely super informative video, especially for its short duration of just under one hour!
