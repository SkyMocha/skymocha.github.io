I am a trans-feminine non-binary jack-of-all-trades video-essayist, editor, photographer, poet, TikToker, model, programmer, sysadmin (unfortunate), researcher, and much, much more located in Portland, Oregon. 

You can find me under one of three aliases:

* SkyMocha (SFW)
* SkyMochi64 (SFW)
* SkyMochi256 (NSFW)

I graduated from The Peddie School in 2022. Since then, I have tried many things. Among the things I decided were not for me is college. I currently work as a video editor for [Nominal.Naomi](https://www.tiktok.com/@nominalnaomi), run an [OnlyFans](https://www.onlyfans.com/skymochi256) account, engage in local activism, and create entertainment & educational content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@skymochi64) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@skymochi64).

## CALL TO: Researchers & Educators

I am currently hoping to get back into non-video education. This might include secondary authorship on conference or journal papers, presentations, speeches, and more! Despite not engaging in college, I have previously worked in academic settings in computer science & cognitive modeling at UCSC and have presented at IEEE's Integrated STEM Education Conference in Princeton, NJ on the disproportionate rate of trans-women in programming fields. If you are from the PDX area, or are willing to work remotely, I would love to assist in your projects and educational endeavors. I am primarily interested in research surrounding sociological inquiry pertaining to my lived experience as a transgender person. 

You can find my major existing works under my [publications](/publications.md) page and contact me [skye@skymocha.net](mailto:skye@skymocha.net)

## CALL TO: Content Creators & Livestreamers 

I will gladly give voice lines or play characters for free in your projects. I love acting. That said, I am a character actor, I can sometimes struggle with natrualistic acting. I do this for fun! :) I have appeared on JohnTheDuncan and CaelenConrad, and some examples of my acting include my spoken word poem _[Rhythmic Trances to the Wrong Song](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4PZDB_vsrQM)_, the opening of my Fight Club video, [an incel manifesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-89UAKcSqI), and my speech, _[Leave Us Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI6H2vYV6gM)_ on The BBC and trans women.

If you are local to PDX, also let me know! I am always down to help with IRL projects or lend my space and equipment! I have done this with one YouTuber, and hope to continue doing this to better learn lighting design.

I also LOVE appearing on other people's livestreams. I have been on Nominal Naomi's livestreams, Sgt Malcoms, Bothered Boys, and my memes have been seen on [Vaush](https://twitter.com/velvetbnuuy/status/1632455656702636032). I can also appear as a live guest to any events in the Portland or Seattle area. 

For any of these you can reach out to my email [skye@skymocha.net](mailto:skye@skymocha.net)
