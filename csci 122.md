## Information
Hi! I'm [Skye Kychenthal](https://www.skymocha.net). The purposes of this website are:
* To facilitate an easier sharing of my homework for the purposes of collaboration, to help out fellow students (copying is NOT permitted)
* To get in the habit/spirit of open-sourcing work. Compared to my main site, this website is incredibly light-weight by being based on simple .html and simple .md files. 
* To serve as a file upload source for the purposes of a [publications.html (temporary)](/pub_temp.html) & [resume](/resume.pdf).

I am currently a freshmen at Reed College, so below is are the current classes I am taking, and the current work that I have published to this website. If you want a more detailed look at who I am, check out:

I periodically update this website through a [script](https://github.com/SkyMocha/skymocha.github.io/blob/main/update.py).

## Notes
All courses taken are at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu). The most up-to-date course catalog can be found [here](https://www.reed.edu/catalog/). As all notes & work done here are written by Skye Kychenthal, they should NOT be submitted as your own original work. This is called plagarism.
