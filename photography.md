## Photography Statement

Currently incomplete.

### Identifiable Features

My intentions with photography are to capture a moment rather than an individual. Beyond this, I will _not_ sacrifice an individuals safety for a better image. Especially in situations such as protests, the fast pace does not allow for asking individuals for permission to photograph. As a result, identifiable features such as a face will be censored. Notable tattoos may or may not be censored. This is all subject to change depending on the event: IE. Pride NYC is different than a protest.

#### I may not censor:

- Public speakers & figures
- Large crowds and groups
- Individuals with masks, bandanas, etc.
- Individuals who give express permission to not censor

#### I will always censor:

- People breaking laws
- People who may be in danger from identification

#### Examples

![NYC Pride Image #1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWM3OfpWIAIK_MR?format=jpg&name=900x900)

This image includes an individual climbing poles in order to get a better view of Pride. Since this could be in violation of the law, the persons face

![NYC Pride Image #2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWMg23GXoAATXrX?format=jpg&name=large)

This image includes a group of individuals in a low stakes situation (an impromptu counter-protest to anti-LGBT protestors at NYC Pride). As a result, faces were not blurred since it would not prove to be a danger to the individuals.
